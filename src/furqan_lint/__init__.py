# not starting with an underscore at module level) is fragile: any
# module-level binding leaks. The explicit ``__all__`` is what the
# additive-only discipline needs to track. Per Bayyinah Engineering
# Discipline Framework section 7.6, every shipped minor and patch
# version gets a named frozenset constant in
# ``tests/test_top_level_public_surface_additive.py``; the current
# tuple here is the source of truth that those constants must remain
# subsets of.
