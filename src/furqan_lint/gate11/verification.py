"""Phase G11.0 T08: nine-step CASM bundle verification.

The Verifier executes the verification flow specified in the
G11.0 prompt:

1. parse bundle (CASM-V-010 on failure)
2. CASM version check (CASM-V-001)
3. language check (CASM-V-001)
4. TUF trust root refresh / fallback (CASM-V-020 ADVISORY,
   CASM-V-021)
5. canonical manifest bytes (RFC 8785)
6. Sigstore verification (CASM-V-030..034)
7. module hash recompute and compare (CASM-V-040)
8. public surface compare (CASM-V-050 removal, CASM-V-051
   non-additive change; INDETERMINATE on DynamicAllError)
9. chain integrity (CASM-V-060, CASM-V-061 ADVISORY)

Each step returns either successfully or raises
``CasmVerificationError`` with a CASM-V code attribute. The
``Verifier.verify_bundle`` entry point composes the steps.

Sigstore verification (step 6) is bundled into a single call
to sigstore-python's high-level Verifier API; the CASM-V-030..
034 codes are mapped from the underlying VerificationError.

Tests synthesize each path without live network: the Sigstore
step is exercised by injecting a faked ``sigstore_bundle`` dict
and asserting that the verifier surfaces the expected
CASM-V-03x code.

# Module-level ``verify(manifest, args)`` function with a private
# ``_LANGUAGE_DISPATCH`` table dispatching to per-language facades
# in ``python_verification.py`` and ``rust_verification.py``. This
# is purely additive: existing callers using
# ``Verifier(...).verify_bundle(...)`` directly are unaffected
# (gate11/cli.py, all tests pre-v0.11.8).
#
# The dispatch table imports the per-language facades **lazily**
# inside the ``verify`` function rather than at module top-level.
# The per-language facade modules import ``Verifier``,
# ``VerificationResult``, and ``TrustConfig`` from this module;
# importing them eagerly here would create a circular import. The
# lazy-import pattern is documented in F-RV-7 of the v1.3 audit.
#
# D24 discipline: ``verify`` uses single-trailing-return shape
# (raise on miss, return on hit) per the v0.8.0 finding. Do NOT
# refactor to ``if handler: return handler(...); raise ...`` --
# D24 doesn't model ``raise`` as terminal and the all-paths-return
# analysis fires MARAD P1.

    """Module-level procedural facade introduced at v0.11.8.

    ``manifest.module_identity['language']``. Raises
    :class:`CasmVerificationError` with code ``CASM-V-001`` if
    the language is not in the dispatch table.

    Parameters:
        manifest: parsed :class:`Manifest` object (informational
            at this layer; the language-specific facade composes
            a Verifier and re-parses the bundle from

    Returns:

        ``CASM-V-001`` if the manifest's language is not in the
        dispatch table (see F-XR-5 audit absorption: positional
