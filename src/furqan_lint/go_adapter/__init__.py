"""Go adapter: opt-in via the ``[go]`` extra.

Provides D24 (all-paths-return) and D11 (status-coverage with the
Go ``(T, error)`` firing shape) on .go source files. The
``goast`` binary is built from
``src/furqan_lint/go_adapter/cmd/goast/main.go`` at install time
via the ``[go]`` extra's PEP 517 build hook; users do not need a
Go toolchain at runtime.

The cross-language may-fail predicate ``_is_may_fail_producer``
(Shape B, locked in v0.8.0 per ADR-002 §10 Q3 follow-up) lives in
``furqan_lint.runner``. The Go adapter imports it directly; it
does not maintain its own predicate.

Public surface
==============

* ``parse_file(path)`` -> ``dict``: invoke the bundled goast
  binary on ``path`` and return parsed JSON.
* ``GoExtrasNotInstalled``: raised when the bundled binary is
  not present. CLI converts to exit code 1 plus the install hint.
* ``GoParseError``: raised when goast fails to parse the source.
  CLI converts to exit code 2 (PARSE ERROR).

Everything else (the translator, the runner, the build hook) is
intentionally not exported.
