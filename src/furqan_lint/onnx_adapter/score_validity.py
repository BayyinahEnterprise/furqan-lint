"""Score-validity advisory check via ``onnx_tool.model_profile``.

Closes Gap 2 (MEDIUM) per Decision 9 of v0.9.2 and round-32
NeuroGolf leverage analysis. Wraps ``onnx_tool.model_profile()``
in stdout-capture and exception-trapping; if profiling fails on
a model that ``onnx.checker`` would accept, the failure is a
deployment-side surface gap (operator missing schema-default
handling in the profiler) rather than a structural fault in
the model itself. Fires as ADVISORY, not MARAD: the model is
structurally valid; only the profiler's coverage is incomplete.

Per Decision 3 of v0.9.4 prompt: ADVISORY findings exit 0;
MARAD findings exit 1. The CLI distinguishes via the
``severity`` field on the diagnostic.

Convention dependency: ``onnx_tool.model_profile`` writes a
profile table to stdout on success (~420 bytes for a Relu
model). Decision 2 wraps the call in
``contextlib.redirect_stdout(io.StringIO())`` so successful
profiles produce no CLI output and only failure surfaces a
diagnostic.

Op-type extraction (Decision 4 / S1): walk the exception
traceback for the deepest frame whose ``f_locals.get("self")``
has an ``op_type`` string attribute; fall back to
``"<unknown>"`` if no match. Heuristic; graceful fallback.
