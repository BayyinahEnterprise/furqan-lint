"""Public-name extraction for Rust source files.

Used by the additive-only diff path (CLI ``furqan-lint diff
old.rs new.rs``). Mirrors
``furqan_lint.go_adapter.public_names.extract_public_names`` in
shape -- returns a frozenset of names exposed by a single file
-- but reads from a tree-sitter CST walk over the Rust grammar
rather than from a JSON binary's emit field.

Implementation uses ``parse_source`` from
``furqan_lint.rust_adapter.parser`` (the existing tree-sitter
direct-bindings entry point); does NOT use
``tree_sitter_languages`` (NOT a project dependency).

Visibility scope (locked decision 2): ``pub`` only. Crate-
private items (``pub(crate)``, ``pub(super)``,
``pub(in path::...)``) are not part of the external API surface
and are skipped.

Item kinds (locked decision 3): ``function_item``,
``struct_item``, ``enum_item``, ``const_item``, ``static_item``,
``type_item``, ``mod_item``. ``trait_item`` is out of scope for
v0.8.2 (a future phase may add it once a concrete consumer
needs trait-name diffing).

Method names are NOT collected here (the v0.8.2 Rust adapter
deliberately walks only top-level items; Rust's ``impl Type {
... }`` blocks contain method definitions but the diff API
treats them as private to the type, mirroring how Go's
qualified-method emission added in v0.8.2 works at the goast
emit boundary).
